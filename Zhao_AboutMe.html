            <p>Hi there! Welcome to my online portfolio. I am a freshman at Dublin
            High School who is taking the elective course Computer Science 
            Principles. I hope that by taking this course, I will be able to learn
            some of the basics for coding. But this is not the career I want to 
            pursue in the future. This is in fact, a backup career is the first 
            on does not work out for me. If in the future, I end up following 
            this path, I plan to take on a job that involves this knowledge 
            because coding is a big part of everything on the Internet. It is 
            the code that creates the unique look of websites, the layouts of 
            apps, and even your computer. You may not know it but coding is all 
            around you. By taking this course, I will be diving deeper in this 
            world that is   integrated into our lives.</p>
            <p>I think that teamwork will help me in this career. I am on a swim
            team during the summer and I work well in group projects. Of the 
            jobs that come to mind, they all involve having good relations with
            your coworkers and cooperation. If you do not have a good connection,
            you may not be able to complete a project successfully or in good 
            quality. I am also a good listener so I notice if someone is being 
            quiet or is not participating. These are usually the type of people 
            I become friends with too. Things I have learned about myself over 
            the years is that I like have close friends, work well on teams, but
            I can also survive alone. I can also adapt to new situations and 
            surroundings pretty well.</p>
            <p>All in all, I think that this career path has a lot of potential
            for me. Thank you for your time! To learn more about me explore my site.

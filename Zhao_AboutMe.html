          <p>Hi there! Welcome to my online portfolio. I am a freshman at Dublin
          High School who is taking the elective course Computer Science 
          Principles. I hope that by taking this course, I will be able to learn
          some of the basics for coding. But this is not the career I want to 
          pursue in the future. This is in fact, a backup career is the first on
          does not work out for me. If in the future, I end up following this 
          path, I plan to take on a job that involves this knowledge because 
          coding is a big part of everything on the Internet. It is the code 
          that creates the unique look of websites, the layouts of apps, and 
          even your computer. You may not know it but coding is all around you. 
          By taking this course, I will be diving deeper in this world that is 
          integrated into our lives.</p>
          <p>Some qualities that I think will help me for this career path is 
          teamwork. I am on a swim team during the summer and I work well in 
          group projects.Of all the jobs that I know, they all involve cooperation
          with your coworkers. If you do not have a good connection, you may not
          be able to complete a project successfully or in good quality. I am also
          a good listener so I notice is someone is being quiet or is not 
          participating. These are usually the type of people I become friends 
          with too. Things I have learned about myself over the years is that I 
          like have close friends, work well on teams, but I can also work alone.
          I can also adapt to new situations and surroundings pretty well.</p>
          <p>All in all, I think that this career path has a lot of potential
          for me. Thanks for you time! To leans more about me explore my site.

        <h5>Career Goal</h5>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Education</h5>
        <p>I am a freshman that attends Dublin High School in Dublin. At this 
        school, I am taking Physical Education, French 1, Biology with Research,
        Freshmen Seminar, Geometry, Computer Science Principles, and English 1.
        I do not know which college I want to apply for because I still have not
        really decided which career path I want to follow. I do hope that I may
        be able to get a scholarship through swimming. Computer science is a 
        backup path in case it does not work out as planned.</p>
        <h5>Volunteer Experience</h5>
        <p>For three days - July 29th, 2018 to July 31st, 2018 - I was a 
        volunteer ball kid for a tennis tournament, Mubadala Silicon Valley 
        Classic, hosted at San Jose State University for Women's Tennis 
        Association (WTA) players. Every day, I worked with a different team for
        about eight hours to help make sure that the match flows as quickly and
        efficiently as possible and the players have everything they need. In 
        order to be a ball kid, you should have some background knowledge of 
        how a match is played and how the score is kept.</p>
        <p>During the last two weeks, from July 9th, 2018 to July 20th, 2018, 
        of my summer swim team, the Dublin Green Gators, I worked as an assistant
        coach. What I would do for one hour after my practice, is help correct 
        and improve the techniques of any younger swimmers that the coaches 
        decided needed help. To do this, I had to be able to analyze the swimmer,
        and think of - maybe even create new - drills to help the swimmer. If I 
        could not think of any or the swimmer was just not picking up the skill,
        I could ask for help from the other assistant coaches. </p>
